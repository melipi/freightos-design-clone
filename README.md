# Freightos Design Clone

## Objective
Recreate the [Freightos](ship.freightos.com) website with as few frameworks as possible. 

### Technologies Used

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Vanilla JS (ES6+)
4. Bootstrap (For the single select dropdowns and the svg icons)

### Challenges

1. Recreating the search options bar
- [Event delegation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#event_delegation) became the key technique for the JS to work on the nested HTML elements

2. Mobile first design
- Flexbox and grid solved any issues for layouts on small screens
